<!--
     Length In Bytes
Instructions
Write a function called byteSize that takes a string as input and returns the size of the string in bytes. The function should work for both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.

Examples
Input	Output
byteSize('hello world')	11
byteSize('안녕하세요')	15
byteSize('')	0
Acceptance Criteria
When the byteSize function is called with a string input, it should return the size of the string in bytes.
The function should work for both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.
The function should handle empty string input and return a byte size of 0.
Extra information in context with this problem:
About the Blob Concept:
In the context of this problem, a Blob object is used to determine the size of the input string in bytes. A Blob represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data, and it can be used to handle both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.

Here's how the Blob is used in this problem:

Creating a Blob Object: A new Blob object is created with the given string. This object represents the raw data of the string.
Getting the Size: The size property of the Blob object returns the size of the string in bytes. This includes the correct handling of non-ASCII characters, which may require more bytes to represent.
This approach allows for an efficient calculation of the byte size of a string, including handling of different character encodings. -->

    const byteSize=(str)=>{
         
        return new Blob([str]).size;

    const str = prompt("Enter some string.");
    alert(byteSize(str));
