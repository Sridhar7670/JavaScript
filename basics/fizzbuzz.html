<!-- 
    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20 using alert.

    For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    For multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    For multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
    Expected Output:
    The output should be a string that contains the numbers from 1 to 100 with "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" substituted for multiples of three, five, and both, respectively.
    Each number/string should be separated by a newline character ("\n").
    Acceptance Criteria:
    Lines that represent multiples of three should contain the string "Fizz".
    Lines that represent multiples of five should contain the string "Buzz".
    Lines that represent multiples of both three and five should contain the string "FizzBuzz".
    Lines that represent numbers that are not multiples of three or five should contain the number itself as a string.
    The output should be in the correct order, with each line corresponding to the correct number.
