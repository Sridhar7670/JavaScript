<!--Difference In Days
Instructions
Write a JavaScript function called dateDiffInDays that takes two dates as inputs and returns the difference in days between the two dates. The function should handle both past and future dates.

Examples
Input	Output
dateDiffInDays("2022-03-01", "2022-03-15")	14
dateDiffInDays("2022-03-01", "2022-03-01")	0
dateDiffInDays("2022-03-15", "2022-03-01")	-14
Acceptance Criteria
The function should return the difference in days between the two dates.
The function should accept two inputs, both of which are valid dates.
The function should return 0 if the two dates are the same.
The function should return a negative number if the second date is before the first date.
The function should handle both past and future dates.
Constraints
The input dates will be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
The input dates will be valid according to the Gregorian calendar.
EXTRA: About Date.UTC:
The Date.UTC method returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00, universal time, for a given date. It ensures consistent calculations across different time zones.

Date.UTC maybe used to:

Convert the input dates to the number of milliseconds since the UTC epoch.
Calculate the difference in milliseconds between the two dates.
Convert the difference to days by dividing by the number of milliseconds in a day.-->
