    Min Cost Ropes
Instructions
There are given N ropes of different lengths, and we need to connect these 
ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to the sum of 
their lengths. The task is to connect the ropes with the minimum cost. You
need to write a function mincost, which takes an array arr containing the
lengths of the ropes and returns the minimum cost as an Integer.

Examples
            Input	Output
            mincost([4, 3, 2, 6])	29  
            mincost([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])	33
Acceptance Criteria
The function must accept an array of integers representing the lengths of the ropes. The length of the array is within the range [1, 10^3], and each element is within the range [1, 10^4].
The function must return an integer representing the minimum cost to connect all the ropes.
Constraints
The length of the array will be within the range [1, 10^3].
Each element of the array will be within the range [1, 10^4].
Additional information to know
- The knowledge of sort function will be useful here
