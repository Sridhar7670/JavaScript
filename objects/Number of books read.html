Each book object in the array has the following properties:

author (string): the name of the book author
title (string): the title of the book
readingStatus (boolean): indicates whether the book has been read (true) or not (false)
The function should count the number of books in the array that have been marked as read (i.e., those with a readingStatus of true) and return that count as a result.

Examples
Input	Output
Given Library	2
Acceptance Criteria
The function should accurately count and return the number of books that have been read from the given object.
The function should work with the given structure of the library object and not modify it.
